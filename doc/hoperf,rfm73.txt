* HopeRF RFM73

This is a standalone RF IC with SPI interface.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "hoperf,rfm73"
- reg: Specify the SPI chip select the module is wired to
- pinctrl-names: List of assigned state names, see pinctrl binding documentation.
- pinctrl-0: List of phandles to configure the GPIO pin used as interrupt line,
             see also generic and your platform specific pinctrl binding
             documentation.
- rfm73,irq: a phandle to the interrupt GPIO
- rfm73,ce: a phandle to the module enable GPIO

Optional properties:
- spi-max-frequency: Maximum frequency of the SPI bus when accessing the module.
  According to the RFM73 datasheet, the module allows a maximum of 8 MHz, however,
  board designs may need to limit this value.

Example:

  &spi2 {
    pinctrl-names = "default";
    pinctrl-0 = <&spi2_pins_a>, <&spi2_cs0_pins_a>;
    status = "okay";

    #address-cells = <1>;
    #size-cells = <0>;
    radio@0 {
      reg = <0>;
      compatible = "hoperf,rfm73";
      spi-max-frequency = <8000000>;
      rfm73,irq = <&pio 1 10 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>; /* PB10 */
      rfm73,ce = <&pio 6 12 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>; /* PG12 */
    };
  };
